- This is a very rough draft. Configure via GUI, specify the host and port of the Wyoming server. Select voice.
- In general, it would be good to figure out if thereâ€™s a standard way of working with languages. The implementation varies across different integrations.
- Long text in the `set_conversation_response` block (e.g., transmitted via a variable) will still cause problems for slow TTS. Although the text is processed in separate parts and could start playing, the finished file for the satellite will only be provided after complete generation.

## A few diagrams
Current implementation for esp32 satellites, using tts with streaming support:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ESPHome Satellite
    participant AssistSatellite Entity
    participant Assist Pipeline
    participant LLM (Agent)
    participant TextToSpeechView (HTTP)
    participant TTS Engine

    ESPHome Satellite->>+AssistSatellite Entity: RunPipeline, AudioStream
    AssistSatellite Entity->>+Assist Pipeline: async_accept_pipeline_from_satellite()
    Note over Assist Pipeline: Stage: STT -> INTENT
    
    Assist Pipeline->>+LLM (Agent): Request response text
    
    %% Parallel processing starts
    loop LLM generates response text
        LLM (Agent)-->>Assist Pipeline: Event: INTENT_PROGRESS (with text delta)
        note right of Assist Pipeline: chat_log_delta_listener
        Assist Pipeline->>+TTS Engine: Sends text chunk for synthesis
        Note over TTS Engine: Starts generating audio and writing to stream
    end
    
    %% Synchronization Point: LLM must finish
    LLM (Agent)-->>-Assist Pipeline: **Full response text (END)**
    Assist Pipeline->>AssistSatellite Entity: Event: INTENT_END
    
    %% Command is sent AFTER LLM is finished
    Assist Pipeline->>AssistSatellite Entity: Event: TTS_END (with a streaming URL)
    AssistSatellite Entity->>+ESPHome Satellite: Command: "Play media from this URL"
    
    %% HTTP Streaming starts now
    ESPHome Satellite->>+TextToSpeechView (HTTP): HTTP GET request to the streaming URL
    Note over TextToSpeechView (HTTP): Opens a chunked transfer encoding response
    
    loop TTS Engine continues generating audio
        TTS Engine-->>TextToSpeechView (HTTP): Audio data chunk
        TextToSpeechView (HTTP)-->>ESPHome Satellite: Sends audio data chunk (HTTP Chunk)
    end

    TTS Engine-->>TextToSpeechView (HTTP): End of audio stream
    TextToSpeechView (HTTP)-->>ESPHome Satellite: End of HTTP response
```

Final expected implementation for esp32 satellites. Modifications are required for HA components (assist_pipeline and assist_satellite). 

Calling Assist via the UI already works in a similar way:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ESPHome Satellite
    participant AssistSatellite Entity
    participant Assist Pipeline
    participant LLM (Agent)
    participant TextToSpeechView (HTTP)
    participant TTS Engine

    ESPHome Satellite->>+AssistSatellite Entity: RunPipeline, AudioStream
    AssistSatellite Entity->>+Assist Pipeline: async_accept_pipeline_from_satellite()
    Note over Assist Pipeline: Stage: STT -> INTENT
    
    Assist Pipeline->>+LLM (Agent): Request response text
    
    %% Parallel processing starts
    loop LLM generates initial 60+ characters
        LLM (Agent)-->>Assist Pipeline: Event: INTENT_PROGRESS (with text delta)
        note right of Assist Pipeline: chat_log_delta_listener
        Assist Pipeline->>+TTS Engine: Sends text chunk for synthesis
    end

    %% "Optimistic Start" Trigger
    note over Assist Pipeline: Streaming threshold reached!
    Assist Pipeline->>+AssistSatellite Entity: **Event: TTS_STREAM_START (with streaming URL)**
    AssistSatellite Entity->>+ESPHome Satellite: **Command: "Play media from this URL" (SENT EARLY)**
    
    %% HTTP streaming starts while LLM is still working
    ESPHome Satellite->>+TextToSpeechView (HTTP): HTTP GET request to the streaming URL
    
    loop LLM and TTS continue in parallel
        LLM (Agent)-->>Assist Pipeline: Next text delta
        Assist Pipeline->>+TTS Engine: Next text chunk
        TTS Engine-->>TextToSpeechView (HTTP): Next audio chunk
        TextToSpeechView (HTTP)-->>ESPHome Satellite: Next HTTP chunk
    end

    LLM (Agent)-->>-Assist Pipeline: **Full response text (END)**
    Assist Pipeline->>AssistSatellite Entity: Event: INTENT_END (now informational)
    
    TTS Engine-->>TextToSpeechView (HTTP): End of audio stream
    TextToSpeechView (HTTP)-->>ESPHome Satellite: End of HTTP response
```

The old method, still used for Wyoming satellite:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Wyoming Satellite
    participant Wyoming AssistSatellite
    participant Assist Pipeline
    participant Agent as LLM (Agent)
    participant TTS Engine

    Wyoming Satellite->>+Wyoming AssistSatellite: RunPipeline, AudioStream
    Wyoming AssistSatellite->>+Assist Pipeline: async_accept_pipeline_from_satellite()
    Note over Assist Pipeline: STT -> Intent
    Assist Pipeline->>+Agent: Request response text
    Agent-->>-Assist Pipeline: Full response text
    Note over Assist Pipeline: TTS
    Assist Pipeline->>+TTS Engine: Request synthesis (with full text)
    TTS Engine-->>-Assist Pipeline: Full audio stream (all chunks)
    Assist Pipeline->>Wyoming AssistSatellite: Event: TTS_END (with stream token)

    Wyoming AssistSatellite->>+Assist Pipeline: async_get_stream(token)
    Assist Pipeline-->>-Wyoming AssistSatellite: ResultStream object
    
    note right of Wyoming AssistSatellite: stream_tts() starts
    Wyoming AssistSatellite->>Wyoming AssistSatellite: Reads the ENTIRE audio stream into memory
    
    Wyoming AssistSatellite->>+Wyoming Satellite: AudioStart
    loop Send chunks one by one
        Wyoming AssistSatellite->>Wyoming Satellite: AudioChunk
    end
    Wyoming AssistSatellite->>-Wyoming Satellite: AudioStop
```
